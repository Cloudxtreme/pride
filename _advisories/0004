Stored XSS in WP User Notes 
----------------------------------

*About*

> This plugin adds a text editor area to each User Profile in the dashboard for Administrators to keep private notes about each User.

*Author*: https://minglecommunities.com/ 

*Timeline*

*Vulnerability*: The notes field for each user isn't properly sanitized and can contain javascript. Given that this only affects admins this really isn't a major issue. However, 

	  $notes = (!empty($_POST['user_notes_note']))?stripslashes($_POST['user_notes_note']):'';
	update_user_meta($user_id, 'user-notes-note', $notes);

*Proof of Concept*: Simply entering the notes with javascript in `<script>` tags is enough to execute code against other administrators.
