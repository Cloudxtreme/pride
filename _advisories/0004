Stored XSS in WP User Notes 
=====

### Credit
This vulnerability has been discovered and reported by Carl Clegg (carl(at)cjc(dot)im)

### Timeline
* 2016-11-06 Vendor Notified

### Product
This plugin adds a text editor area to each User Profile in the dashboard for Administrators to keep private notes about each User.

### Risk / Severity Rating
Not calculated

### Description and Impact
The notes field for each user isn't properly sanitized and can contain javascript. Given that this only affects admins this really isn't a major issue. However, 

	  $notes = (!empty($_POST['user_notes_note']))?stripslashes($_POST['user_notes_note']):'';
	update_user_meta($user_id, 'user-notes-note', $notes);

### Proof of Concept
Simply entering the notes with javascript in `<script>` tags is enough to execute code in the context of other administrators. 

### Solution
Disable the plugin until an upgrade is available
