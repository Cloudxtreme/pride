Running denyhosts on the honeypot
---------------------------------

Unsurprisingly, there was a significant reduction in the number of attempts as the denyhosts daemon bans IP addresses after a specific number of attempts. Overall there was 277 IP Addresses that were added to the blacklist. From the blacklisted hosts, there was a further 1673 attempts rejected. There was a total of 2117 failed attempts, down from the usual numbers in the 100,000 sort of range.

SSH Login attempts
------------------

Even quieter over this period

```
Attempts | Login
1270     | root
103      | ubnt
69       | admin
49       | support
27       | guest
20       | pi
13       | ftpuser
```

Trailing off very quickly thanks to deny hosts, the pi username has shot up the rankings this week! 

Next week, different port, no denyhosts.
