minimalism is dead, long live minimalism
----------------------------------------

I made the mistake of searching the internet for "minmal website design examples" in some mis-guided quest to inspire some work on this site some more. I was shocked to find what qualifies as minimalism.

I expected to see things along the lines of Leo Babauta's [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com) and [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net). But it seems minimalism in website design seems to be more than less.

Minimalism is dead. Long live minimalism.

PS. I didn't update the css.
