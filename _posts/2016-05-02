Studying for CISSP
------------------

I have started studying for taking the CISSP exam today. I plan on joining as an associate since I have less than a years experience working in a security related role. Studying this material will hopefully benefit my role as well as help me understand things from a high level rather than down in the technical stuff.

I took the 40 question practice exam at the start of the Official Study Guide and scored 65%. This I feel is pretty good considering.

I need to really update the look of the site. I feel the static site generator I wrote as a bash script is working as well as I need it to at this point and very little extra is required. Perhaps I should also add some extra pages.
