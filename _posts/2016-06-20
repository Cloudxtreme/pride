Docker tor client
-----------------

I have been playing with Docker as a lightweight alternative to using full on virtual machines for specific tasks as the Compute Stick isn't exactly the most powerful machine in the world.

For my first little image I built a very minimal tor client that uses elinks and torify to be able to connect to websites via tor, or access onion addresses.

You can find the source for the Docker file [here](https://github.com/i-am-cjc/docker-tor) or run it with:

`docker run -it iamcjc/docker-tor`
