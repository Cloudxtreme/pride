A Walkthrough of my vimrc
-------------------------

An ever evolving file, my vim config is generally tailored towards development using a fairly standard webstack. This post is mostly justifying to myself why some of the file is required, and will probably lead to some being removed.

### Plugins

> set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
> call vundle#rc()
> 
> Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
> Plugin 'itchyny/lightline.vim'
> Plugin 'sjl/gundo.vim'
> Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
> Plugin 'jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator'

* Vundle - The plugin manager itself
* Lightline - Have a nice status bar at the bottom of each buffer
* Gundo - Fancy undo tree functionality with diff between the current state and the state in the undo tree
* Nerdtree - Nice in-vim file browser, I have seen lots of arguments saying this is pointless, but it looks nice and I am used to it. Maybe I will try without this in the future
* BufferGator - Easy interface for buffers.

### Leader controls

The leader key is a great thing, so much so I am considering getting a keyboard that I can program the layout for to use this at a keyboard level rather than just in vim, but I digress...

> let mapleader = "\<Space>"

Set the leader key to space, since it's always got a thumb on it

> nnoremap <Leader>. :o .<CR>
> nnoremap <Leader>w :w<CR>
> nnoremap <Leader>x :wq<CR>

Allow opening and saving of files with the leader key.

> imap jj <esc>

When in insert mode, pressing j twice will return to normal mode. I saw several solutions to avoid having to reach all the way to the esc key to do this (miles away!) this seemed the quickest, and I don't think there are (m)any words that have jj in it.

> nnoremap <Leader>h <c-w><Left>
> nnoremap <Leader>l <c-w><Right>
> nnoremap <Leader>k <c-w><Up>
> nnoremap <Leader>j <c-w><Down>

Move around windows with hjkl

> nnoremap <Leader>u :GundoToggle<CR>
> nnoremap <Leader>b :BuffergatorToggle<CR>
> nnoremap <Leader>t :NERDTreeToggle<CR>

Have easier access to plugins using the leader key
