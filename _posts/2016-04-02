OpenBSD running the static site generator

Definitely bares bones right now, using xterm which doesn't really seem very swish, and using `links -g` as a browser since it works ;).

I need to sort out the wm, and decide if I am going to keep using the default fvwm. Decide if I am going to use a browser outside of `links -g`. I mostly read a few news sites and nothing that might really require much more.
