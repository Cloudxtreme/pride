New VPS for a new Honeypot
--------------------------

Started running a Honeypot that will allow attackers to SSH in and run certain commands, it will record these commands in a log. It will also allow the attacker to use the `wget` or `curl` commands and capture these files for later analysis. 

I set this up last night and have a single hit thus far. Looking forward to analysing the results next week!
