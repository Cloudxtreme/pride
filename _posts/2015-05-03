I trawled through the logs of the honeypot vps
----------------------------------------------

As specified in the last post, I bought a VPS with the simple intention of letting it sit idle to see what (I can only guess) automated attempts at log in and access.

For this first little attempt, I left ssh running on the default port, and a bare httpd with no content to see what users attempted to log in, where from and what web addresses were attempted.

SSH login attempts
------------------

First off, lets look at the very predictable top 10 username attempts.

```
Attempts | Login
  189762 | root
      82 | admin
      46 | guest
      44 | test
      33 | oracle
      26 | git
      20 | mysql
      19 | support
      19 | info
      18 | ftpuser
```

A major win for root login attempts, no surprises there, same with the other in the top 10. An honourable mention should go out to he username `pi` which had 9 attempts over the course of the week. `pi` of course is the default username for the raspian linux distro. Pretty cool that it is on the list of default usernames to try.

IP Address access
------------------

There are literally too many IP addresses to list, or even do a top ten. Over the course of the week, there were around 190,000 login attempts to the VPS. A couple of interesting points to note about the addesses is that there was a significant chunk from the same subnet, which according to a quick search shows that it is a Hong Kong based ISP. Each of the IP addresses in the same subnet scanned between a few hundred and a few thousand times. 
The majority of the other addresses came from China. I have yet to really look up every single IP address, this might be an improvement for future reports.

HTTP Access addresses
------------------

Given that there is no hostname associated with the VPS (yet) there wasnt all that much traffic.

```
Amount | URL
    44 | /manager/html
    17 | http://www.******.com/
    18 | /
     3 | /phph/php/ph.php
     2 | /rom-0
```

Tackling these interesting requests in reverse order. 

* rom-0 appears to be releated to some router exploit. 
* phph/php/ph.php apparently is an attempt to force a 404 not found error in order to extract information from the webserver, makes sense I guess (there was a couple more of these requests following a similar pattern further down the request logs). 
* / is just access the root of the ip address, guess that is something to check. Some of these will be myself making sure that the webserver was indeed running.
* Then we hit an interesting form of advertising, spamming my request logs with a domain name (obfuscated because fuck advertising for them) 
* /manager/html is related to Tomcat, guessing there is enough exploits for this to be worth scanning for

Interesting mention on the httpd logs was that there was 5 scans from masscan which is pretty cool.
