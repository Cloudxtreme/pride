Minimal Keyboard or how small can we go
=======================================

So, I finally finished soldering the Planck keyboard kit which is a 40% board consisting of 48 keys.

The other "oddity" of this board is that it is ortholinear, where the keys are in a grid formation rather than staggered on traditional layouts. This took a few hours of working to get used to but feels fine and natural again.

I will have to edit my vim configuration in order to take advantage of the new layout, including dedicated cursor keys which my last keyboard didn't have despite being bigger.
