Advent of Code Day 1
----------

It's that time of year again!!!!!!

<http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1> for details of the puzzle.

Here is my very quick and dirty python to solve day one part one.

    total = 0
    for index in range(0, len(test)):
        x = int(test[index], 10)
        if index + 1 >= len(test):
            y = int(test[0])
        else:
            y = int(test[index+1], 10)

        if x == y:
            total += x

    print(total)
                                                
Not attempting to do any level of engineering here, just solve these easy levels as they are pretty simple.

The 2nd level was a slight change that required some minor changes

    test2 = test + test
    dist = int(len(test)/2)

    total = 0
    for index in range(0, len(test)):
        x = int(test2[index], 10)
        y = int(test2[index + dist])

        if x == y:
            total += x

    print(total)

Done. See you tomorrow
