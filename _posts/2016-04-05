Changes to how pages are linked
-------------------------------

The next feature I have (or will have at the time of writing) added is the notion of pages being either public or private. Public pages are to be shown on the front page as part of the menu at the top. Private pages are just generated and not explicitly linked to. This is so that other pages, or posts can then link to them.

An example of this, which is also linked to from the about page is [here](/page/static-site-generator)

The problem that this brings is that all the links are stored in the content, and if that changes the links become dead, this is something that needs adressing in the future.
