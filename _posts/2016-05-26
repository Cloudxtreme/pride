Minimal viable computer 
-----------------------

I am fascinated with the recent trend of single board computers. I am also intrigued by the idea of using one of these computers as a primary machine. 

To that end, I am going to setup an Intel Compute Stick (quad core atom, 2gb ram, 32gb storage) to be able to perform my usual day to day activities and see how it goes. I also have a NexDock en route that will make this much more viable.
