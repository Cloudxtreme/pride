Nokia N900, PostMarketOS and automatically turning off the screen
---------

The Nokia N900[1] has to be my favorite handheld device of all time, even more so than the Nintendo Gameboy ;)

I recently discovered PostmarketOS[2], based on Alpine Linux[3] that intends to be a replacement phone OS with a 10 year lifespan. This also led me to discover that the N900 has mostly mainline Linux Kernel Support.

The one thing I wanted to happen was that the screen powers off when the keyboard slides closed. Which is done by editing `/etc/acpi/handler.sh` as such:


	KP_SLIDE_OPEN)
		adjust_keypad_bl 255	
		echo 0 > /sys/devices/platform/omapdrm.0/graphics/fb0/blank
		;;
	KP_SLIDE_CLOSE)
		adjust_keypad_bl 0
		echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/omapdrm.0/graphics/fb0/blank


This looks like it would also be the place to do things with the other hardware buttons on the device. More to come on this device!
