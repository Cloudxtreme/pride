Bit of a folder structure change
--------------------------------

Each post and page now has a date and a folder. Pages go into `page/` and posts into `log/` This could be customisible in the future perhaps.

Started to get some standard formatting for the posts.

* The file name is the date of the post, which is also used in the index and on the front page.
* The first line of the file is the title which is on the index and it's folder name to produce the nicer looking URLs

58 lines of code and counting. Still to style the page.
