Minimal static site generator
-----------------------------

...and it's what generated this page!

I have been looking at a lot of the static site generators out there, but most if not all I can find are just too much and too feature rich for what I want.

The plan is to slowly improve this over time to fit what **I** Need it to do and nothing more as I am selfish like that.

Written as a single shell script, it currently features:

* Markdown support thanks to the script provided from [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* Page support (such as that very slim about page)
* "Blog" support ie generating another bunch of pages in descending time order

Current TODO

* Add a limit to the number of blog posts and add in an archive page
* Upload to github
* Add in some basic styling
