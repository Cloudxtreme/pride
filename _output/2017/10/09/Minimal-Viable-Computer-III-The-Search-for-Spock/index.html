<p>Well, not really a minimal viable computer, but my favorite toy. Here are some notes for installation of PostMarketOS onto the N900</p>
<p>Most of this information is available on the wiki[1] But still worth noting some of my difficulties / changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing the uboot bootloader required root, and also would only install via the command line. This required installing 'rootsh' from the Maemo Package Manager and then installing uboot via apt-get.</li>
<li>See previous post for Modifying the ACPI handler to turn off the screen when closing the keyboard and turning it on when opening.</li>
<li>Compile the OS and setup as per [1]</li>
<li>The screen might say that the hardware keyboard isn't supported, but it is, you can enter the encryption passcode on the device.</li>
<li>The wiki's notes on battery life don't seem to be working for me.</li>
<li>Best hardware every, just could do with some more ram ;)</li>
</ul>
