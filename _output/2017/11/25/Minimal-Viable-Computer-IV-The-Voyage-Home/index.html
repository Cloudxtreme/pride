<p>How minimal can we go? I have always toyed with designing a CPU, be it building a Z80 based machine, to writing emulators for made up systems.</p>
<p>I have been writing a simple emulator for a system that is a hybrid of Caxton Foster's Blue CPU, which had a massive 16 OPcodes, and introducing a simple &quot;display&quot; that is essentially a 32x32 monochrome screen.(that is easy to implement as a CLI system)</p>
<p>The Specs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Instructions, detailed below</li>
<li>4096 memory locations, each with 16bits / 2 bytes in each (8k of memory over a 16bit bus)</li>
<li>A single register, A</li>
<li>A program counter, PC</li>
<li>Instruction Register, IR, that stores the memory pulled in the memory at the PC address.</li>
<li>A 32x32 monochrome display that is read from 0xFBF to 0xFFF (ie the top of memory)</li>
</ul>
<p>The instructions are mostly the same as the Blue CPU, except the Console Switch OP Code is replaced with a call that some ficticious display will &quot;render&quot; the screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>0x0 - NOP - No Operation</li>
<li>0x1 - ADD - Set A to be the sum of A and the provided memory address, ie 10AA would sum the contents of A and what ever is in memory at the address of 0x0AA</li>
<li>0x2 - XOR - Set A to be the XOR of A and the provided memory address</li>
<li>0x3 - AND - Set A to be the AND of A and the provided memory address</li>
<li>0x4 - OR - Set A to be the OR of A and the provided memory address</li>
<li>0x5 - NOT - Set A to be the NOT of A</li>
<li>0x6 - LDA - Set A to be the contents of the provided memory address</li>
<li>0x7 - STA - Save A to the provided memory address</li>
<li>0x8 - SRJ - Set A to PC AND 0xFFF, set the PC to provided memory address</li>
<li>0x9 - JMA - If A &amp; 0x8000 then PC = ADDR</li>
<li>0xA - JMP - PC = ADDR</li>
<li>0xB - INP - A = get a character</li>
<li>0xC - OUT - Write out a character that is in A</li>
<li>0xD - RAL - Rotate A left</li>
<li>0xE - DRW - Draw the screen</li>
<li>0xF - HLT - Halt the CPU</li>
</ul>
<p>An example program written in assembly for helloworld:</p>
<pre><code>LDA 0x014
OUT
LDA 0x015
OUT
LDA 0x016
OUT
OUT
LDA 0x017
OUT
LDA 0x018
OUT
LDA 0x017
OUT
LDA 0x019
OUT
LDA 0x016
OUT
LDA 0x01a
OUT
HLT</code></pre>
<p>Which would have the data for hello world after the halt. This program in hex is:</p>
<pre><code>00000000  60 14 c0 00 60 15 c0 00  60 16 c0 00 c0 00 60 17  |`...`...`.....`.|
00000010  c0 00 60 18 c0 00 60 17  c0 00 60 19 c0 00 60 16  |..`...`...`...`.|
00000020  c0 00 60 1a c0 00 f0 00  00 68 00 65 00 6c 00 6f  |..`......h.e.l.o|
00000030  00 77 00 72 00 64                                 |.w.r.d|</code></pre>
<p>In which you can see the required characters at the end of the binary dump</p>
<p>Currently I have the emulator working for most things. There is no assembler, but there is a disassembler built into the emulator.</p>
