 / <a href="/posts">posts</a> / Wallabys Nightmare Walkthrough</h2>
<p>So, I finally took the plunge and decided to attempt a machine from vulnhub, starting with the newest post, Wallaby's Nightmare.</p>
<h3 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h3>
<p>First was a cursory nmap scan of the machine, revealing port 80 open and 6667 filtered.</p>
<p>So, irc is there but I can't connect, and a webserver is open. Lets jump in and see what the webserver has to offer.</p>
<p>After entering my name I noticed a few attempts of some injection on the page variable led to the machine no longer listening on port 80, which at first I thought was it crashing, but it turns out was part of the design.</p>
<p>Another nmap scan showed that port 60080 was now being used. Sneaky!</p>
<p>Broke out dirb, to see if there was anything interesting on there to no avail.</p>
<p>Attempting a Local File Inclusion gave me:</p>

<p>walfin and steven? -- (See more on this later, brute forcing these users led to nothing)</p>
<p>Lets try another approach here, dirb on the page variable, we know of home and blacklist here. The blacklist was actually running from javascript to block someone, but I failed to do any SQLi on it...</p>

<p>What's this mailer page? Lets take a look, and view the page source...</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!--a href=&#39;/?page=mailer&amp;mail=mail wallaby &quot;message goes here&quot;&#39;&gt;&lt;button type=&#39;button&#39;&gt;Sendmail&lt;/button--&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This can't just be running commands, right? it is....</p>
<pre><code>http://192.168.56.101:60080/?page=mailer&amp;mail=ls%20-l</code></pre>
<p>cat the index.php which gave us...</p>
<pre><code>elseif (strpos($page, &#39;/etc/passwd&#39;) !== false) {
    include &#39;s13!34g$3FVA5e@ed/honeypot.php&#39;;
    }</code></pre>
<p>haha so that was fake, nice</p>
<p>Ok, so now we can run some commands, and we know we have php, lets get a reverse shell going so we can run commands easier than through a php script. Using http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/web-shells/php-reverse-shell which we get across by running a local server and issuing a wget command via the mail parameter. From this we now have a shell as the www-data user that the webserver is running as.</p>
<p>Maybe I could proxy the ircd port and see what's there</p>
<pre><code>nc -l -k -p 5678 &lt; fifo | nc localhost 6667 &gt; fifo</code></pre>
<p>Not working, lets have a nosey around all the directories we can access as the www-data user</p>
<p>Noticed a .sudo_as_admin_successful, interesting that a couple of users can both issue sudo commands, what can www-data user do? We find out by running sudo -l, we can run iptables, and a vim command to change some apache file. we clear the ip tables to allow us to access the irc server.</p>
<p>On the irc network there is an irc bot, sopel bot, which has a .run command to run commands on the server, however this can only be issued as the waldo irc user, which is online and in use, drat...</p>
<p>Looking back at the output from sudo -l, lets run vim as waldo</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u waldo /usr/bin/vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</code></pre>
<p>Ok, in vim, as waldo we can run :!/bin/sh to gain a shell as waldo, run ps -a, get the process number for his irc client and kill it!</p>
<p>On irc, switch nick to waldo and now we can use the .run command, created a script in /tmp that runs in the context of wallaby, who, strangely can sudo all the things, game over.</p>
<pre><code>sudo ls /root
sudo cat /root/flag.txt</code></pre>
<p>done</p>
