<p>The Nokia N900 lives again!</p>
<p>Fed up of lugging a laptop with me for the occasional hax, I have rebuilt pmOS for the N900. Thanks to the brilliant developers who keep pushing the development for this 9-ish year old device I now have a little workstation I can either use the device standalone as a handheld, or plug in via USB to ssh into. Some people call this the perfect hardware... or at least I do.</p>
<p>I have previously attempted this with a RaspberryPi Zero W, which was great, but it didn't have a built in keyboard and screen or a battery. It did have a bit more ram than the N900's 256mb, but who's counting eh.</p>
<p>Given that I only use this in terminal mode, I have implemented my previous script that disables the display when the device is closed with the option of turning the screen on with the camera button if I want to have it monitoring things on my desk. See <a href="https://cjc.im/2017/10/08/Nokia-N900,-PostMarketOS-and-automatically-turning-off-the-screen/">here</a> for the details of this.</p>
<p>The bible of information is the <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900">wiki page</a> on the postmarketos site.</p>
<p>ps. I wrote this on the device itself, what a world we live in!</p>
