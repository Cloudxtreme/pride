<p>The other day I have bought a mega-super-dirt-cheap VPS ($10 for the year!) without advertising the ip or allocating a hostname to it (yet) with the intention of logging all attempts to access it (either via ssh or http for now).</p>
<p>In a couple of days it has accrued over 10 thousand ssh login attempts and quite a few interesting urls on the httpd.</p>
<p>My intention is to write up a little entry about the access and discuss anything interesting that comes out of this experiment every month or so.</p>
