 / <a href="/posts">posts</a> / I trawled through the logs of the honeypot vps</h2>
<p>As specified in the last post, I bought a VPS with the simple intention of letting it sit idle to see what (I can only guess) automated attempts at log in and access.</p>
<p>For this first little attempt, I left ssh running on the default port, and a bare httpd with no content to see what users attempted to log in, where from and what web addresses were attempted.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-login-attempts">SSH login attempts</h2>
<p>First off, lets look at the very predictable top 10 username attempts.</p>
<pre><code>Attempts | Login
  189762 | root
      82 | admin
      46 | guest
      44 | test
      33 | oracle
      26 | git
      20 | mysql
      19 | support
      19 | info
      18 | ftpuser</code></pre>
<p>A major win for root login attempts, no surprises there, same with the other in the top 10. An honourable mention should go out to he username <code>pi</code> which had 9 attempts over the course of the week. <code>pi</code> of course is the default username for the raspian linux distro. Pretty cool that it is on the list of default usernames to try.</p>
<h2 id="ip-address-access">IP Address access</h2>
<p>There are literally too many IP addresses to list, or even do a top ten. Over the course of the week, there were around 190,000 login attempts to the VPS. A couple of interesting points to note about the addesses is that there was a significant chunk from the same subnet, which according to a quick search shows that it is a Hong Kong based ISP. Each of the IP addresses in the same subnet scanned between a few hundred and a few thousand times. The majority of the other addresses came from China. I have yet to really look up every single IP address, this might be an improvement for future reports.</p>
<h2 id="http-access-addresses">HTTP Access addresses</h2>
<p>Given that there is no hostname associated with the VPS (yet) there wasnt all that much traffic.</p>
<pre><code>Amount | URL
    44 | /manager/html
    17 | http://www.******.com/
    18 | /
     3 | /phph/php/ph.php
     2 | /rom-0</code></pre>
<p>Tackling these interesting requests in reverse order.</p>
<ul>
<li>rom-0 appears to be releated to some router exploit.</li>
<li>phph/php/ph.php apparently is an attempt to force a 404 not found error in order to extract information from the webserver, makes sense I guess (there was a couple more of these requests following a similar pattern further down the request logs).</li>
<li>/ is just access the root of the ip address, guess that is something to check. Some of these will be myself making sure that the webserver was indeed running.</li>
<li>Then we hit an interesting form of advertising, spamming my request logs with a domain name (obfuscated because fuck advertising for them)</li>
<li>/manager/html is related to Tomcat, guessing there is enough exploits for this to be worth scanning for</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting mention on the httpd logs was that there was 5 scans from masscan which is pretty cool.</p>
