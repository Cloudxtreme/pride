<p>A little quieter over this period</p>

<p>Tailing off pretty quickly there as expected, compared to the last week of logging. Interesting new appearences in the top 10 of ubnt (ubuntu?) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagios">nagios</a>, alex (No idea) and PlcmSp1p, which apparently is the default username that Polycom SIP phones use to download a config from an ftp server.</p>
<h2 id="ip-address-access">IP Address access</h2>
<p>Nothing much different here from last time, ideally I want to implement so automated geolookup to create a graph or something sexy! (Perhaps for the next report)</p>
<h2 id="httpd-access">httpd Access</h2>
<p>In a shocking turn of events.</p>
<pre><code>Amount | URL / Attack vector?
114    | /phpmyadmin/scripts/setup.php (or variants of, phpmyadmin)
51     | /manager/html (Tomcat)
4      | /wp/wp-login.php (or variants of, Wordpress login)</code></pre>
<p>In a shocking turn of events, phpmyadmin has arrived to the number on this week, with Tomcat taking the second place. A couple of one of other interesting things were attempted, including a couple more /cycy/cy/cy.php a-like requests. Finally, an interesting request was made to</p>
<p><code>/%70%68%70%70%61%74%68/%70%68%70?%2D%64+%61%6C%6C%6F%77%5F%75%72%6C%5F%69%6E%63%6C%75%64%65%3D%6F%6E+%2D%64+%73%61%66%65%5F%6D%6F%64%65%3D%6F%66%66+%2D%64+%73%75%68%6F%73%69%6E%2E%73%69%6D%75%6C%61%74%69%6F%6E%3D%6F%6E+%2D%64+%64%69%73%61%62%6C%65%5F%66%75%6E%63%74%69%6F%6E%73%3D%22%22+%2D%64+%6F%70%65%6E%5F%62%61%73%65%64%69%72%3D%6E%6F%6E%65+%2D%64+%61%75%74%6F%5F%70%72%65%70%65%6E%64%5F%66%69%6C%65%3D%70%68%70%3A%2F%2F%69%6E%70%75%74+%2D%6E</code></p>
<p>which after some url decoding turns into</p>
<p><code>/phppath/php?-d allow_url_include=on -d safe_mode=off -d suhosin.simulation=on -d disable_functions=&quot;&quot; -d open_basedir=none -d auto_prepend_file=php://input -n</code></p>
<p>Guessing that is has been url encoded as an attempt to not trigger an IDS? Now, I am no expert on php config, but allowing url includes would lead to allowing a remote file includes. Not good.</p>
<p>Only 3 hits from masscan on the httpd this week :(</p>
<p>For the next week of logging, I am going to install something like denyhosts to see how much that tails off the login attempts, and maybe change the ssh port the week after!</p>
