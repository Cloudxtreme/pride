<h2 id="ssh-login-attempts">SSH Login attempts</h2>
<p>Running the SSHD on a different port than standard, no deny hosts locking out anything led to a mere 300 attempts to login as root. No other users were tried.</p>
<pre><code>Attempts | Login
300      | root</code></pre>
<p>A combination of a non-standard port and running a software solution such as denyhosts would dramatically reduce the login attempts from hundreds of thousands, down to hundreds.</p>
<p>I have been slacking somewhat with these reports and making use of the VPS. Perhaps focussing more on the httpd side of things now that I have investigated the effects of port / deny hosts on the SSHD</p>
