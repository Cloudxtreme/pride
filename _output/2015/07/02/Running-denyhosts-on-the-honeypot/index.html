<p>Unsurprisingly, there was a significant reduction in the number of attempts as the denyhosts daemon bans IP addresses after a specific number of attempts. Overall there was 277 IP Addresses that were added to the blacklist. From the blacklisted hosts, there was a further 1673 attempts rejected. There was a total of 2117 failed attempts, down from the usual numbers in the 100,000 sort of range.</p>
<h2 id="ssh-login-attempts">SSH Login attempts</h2>
<p>Even quieter over this period</p>
<pre><code>Attempts | Login
1270     | root
103      | ubnt
69       | admin
49       | support
27       | guest
20       | pi
13       | ftpuser</code></pre>
<p>Trailing off very quickly thanks to deny hosts, the pi username has shot up the rankings this week!</p>
<p>Next week, different port, no denyhosts.</p>
