<p>I made the mistake of searching the internet for &quot;minmal website design examples&quot; in some mis-guided quest to inspire some work on this site some more. I was shocked to find what qualifies as minimalism.</p>
<p>I expected to see things along the lines of Leo Babauta's <a href="http://mnmlist.com">mnmlist</a> and <a href="http://zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>. But it seems minimalism in website design seems to be more than less.</p>
<p>Minimalism is dead. Long live minimalism.</p>
<p>PS. I didn't update the css.</p>
