<p>I have to admit, even using the compute stick for a few things was painful. A VM Running on my macbook dominates it in every single way, add to this the nexdock delays due to a fire in their factories, I think the MacBook with VMs for other operating systems is the way forward. As much as the minimalism of a single board computer or similar appeals to me, the pure practicality of a decent machine just outweighs this for me.</p>
