 / <a href="/posts">posts</a> / Bit of a folder structure change</h2>
<p>Each post and page now has a date and a folder. Pages go into <code>page/</code> and posts into <code>log/</code> This could be customisible in the future perhaps.</p>
<p>Started to get some standard formatting for the posts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The file name is the date of the post, which is also used in the index and on the front page.</li>
<li>The first line of the file is the title which is on the index and it's folder name to produce the nicer looking URLs</li>
</ul>
<p>58 lines of code and counting. Still to style the page.</p>
