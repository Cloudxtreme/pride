 / <a href="/posts">posts</a> / Another day another post - Installing OpenBSD</h2>
<p>Decided in some spare time to setup a VM using OpenBSD, it's been a <strong>long</strong> time since I have used the OS and I think it's time I gave it another shot. Hopefully I can run this static site generator on there since it's just a shell script I don't see why it wouldn't work.</p>
<p>I initially setup an old Lenovo laptop with OpenBSD, but really, I have my main laptop that can run a buttload of virtual machines, so it seems quite pointless to have something else to carry around</p>
<p>The next step in the site generator is to add a couple more features and optimizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the <code>HTML</code> is embedded for generating the links. I might implement a really basic templating engine so I can take out the presentation of the page elements like the menu links and the post links to a template file</li>
<li>Add an optional command that can automatically upload to the host (ie scp the files)</li>
<li>Name it, because even if only I use it, I would like to be able to type something shorter than Static Site Generator</li>
</ul>
