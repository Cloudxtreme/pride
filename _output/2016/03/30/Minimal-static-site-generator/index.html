<p>...and it's what generated this page!</p>
<p>I have been looking at a lot of the static site generators out there, but most if not all I can find are just too much and too feature rich for what I want.</p>
<p>The plan is to slowly improve this over time to fit what <strong>I</strong> Need it to do and nothing more as I am selfish like that.</p>
<p>Written as a single shell script, it currently features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown support thanks to the script provided from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Daring Fireball</a></li>
<li>Page support (such as that very slim about page)</li>
<li>&quot;Blog&quot; support ie generating another bunch of pages in descending time order</li>
</ul>
<p>Current TODO</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a limit to the number of blog posts and add in an archive page</li>
<li>Upload to github</li>
<li>Add in some basic styling</li>
</ul>
