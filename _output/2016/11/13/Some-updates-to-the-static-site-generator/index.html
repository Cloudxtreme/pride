<p>In a rare turn of events, I have made some changes to the shell script that I use to generate this site. I realised with the last post about &quot;Minimal viable computer&quot; that with the previous post that had the same name it wasn't... viable to have two with the same name.</p>
<p>Updates to the rescue, posts are now put into YY/mm/DD/TITLE folders.</p>
