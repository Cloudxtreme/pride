<p>In the not so distant past, I wrote a short article once per week about some of the more interesting Information Security news items for a tech website. I'm gonna do the same here, it keeps me interested in the news and forces me to think about some of the items critically.</p>
<h3 id="incorrect-handling-of-password-checking-with-luks">Incorrect Handling of password checking with LUKS</h3>
<p>With physical access to a machine that encrypts its rootfs with LUKS, after a set number of failed attempts, it's possible to drop to a root shell on the system. This would allow an attacker to either brute force the encryption passphrase, or make a copy of the drive without having to remove it.</p>

<h3 id="nginx-priv-esclation">Nginx priv esclation</h3>
<p>On debian based systems, the packaged version of nginx had log files owned by root. It is then possible to symlink this file to another abitrary file (through a compromised web application say) so that upon the logs being rotated said file is written to. Via this it's possible to escalate from the www-data to root.</p>
